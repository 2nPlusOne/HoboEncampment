Hobo Encampment: Rules, tips, and nuances:
Hobo Encampment (HE) is a unique game in the sense that all save data is shown on screen.  You effectively are using a terminal to edit a file, with strict rules.  This means saves are very modifiable for your own experimentation.
Start a playthrough by loading an old save or making a new game.  These will be saved to the folder that your game file is in.  I recommend normal mode for a map, as the values are optimized for a high quality world.
Once you are in, you will move with WASD, followed by the enter key.  You cannot walk on water, and moving through unimproved land ('%','&','#') will be harder than on paths.  You will gain one log for each movement on this land, however.
You may injure yourself crossing unimproved land, but you also may find food.  Once you cross land enough, it will turn into a basic path. to 
These paths are easier to traverse, and actions can be taken from them.  The most basic action is interact, or 'i'.
This will allow you to drink from water, to finish a building project, and to take materials from a source.
